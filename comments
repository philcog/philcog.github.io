Phicogsci provides a venue for expanding the analysis and discussion of the philosophical topics raised in the reading group on philosophy of mind and cognitive science organized by philosophers at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. For this reason we encourage honest and non-abusive comments that contribute to the discussion of the issues raised on the blog. Although we permit anonymous commenting, we request that all commentators submit a valid email address along with their comments and encourage the use of pseudonyms for those who wish to remain anonymous. This will make it so much easier in the context of long threads to refer back to particular comments made on the blog.
