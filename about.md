[Phicogsci](http://philcog.github.io/) is a group blog that follows the activities of the reading group organized by philosophers at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. The interests of the contributors and members of the reading group cover a wide range of topics in philosophy of mind, philosophy of perception, and cognitive science. Combining different perspectives and analytic skills, we explore together the interaction between classical philosophical themes and new theoretical hypotheses developed in cognitive science and neuroscience. For this purpose we focus on a series of new publications whose aim is to provide a scientifically informed outlook on philosophical questions about the relation between brain and cognition and analyze their prospects as well as the challenges they might face.
