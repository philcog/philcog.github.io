The new mechanical philosophy abounds in causal concepts such as activities, interactions, production, causal relevance, causal processes, causal roles and counterfactual difference makers. This plurality of causal concepts suggests different ways of thinking about causation. Many recent regularity, difference-making and mechanistic accounts of causation have focused on elucidating how causes are found and used in scientific practice. It has been argued that this methodologically driven approach provides a more tractable way of thinking about causal claims and their truth-makers, but more metaphysically inclined philosophers have pushed back demanding a systematic analysis that grounds ontologically the category of causation. 

The aim of this workshop is to expand the dialogue between these two perspectives by addressing a series of questions which arise from the double edged requirement of developing metaphysical theses about causation and mechanisms that are in line with current scientific practice. 


- Is a mechanistic approach required to ground ontologically the category of causation?
- How is causal production as an intrinsic relation between events related to causal relevance as a counterfactual notion which seems to involve difference-making?
- Is a nominalist metaphysics for mechanisms compatible with a counterfactual account of causal relevance? 
- Can a mechanistic approach offer an informative analysis of the notion of causal relevance that would also mirror the scientific practices of causal discovery and inference?
- Is the mechanistic notion of constitution useful for solving the puzzle of downward causation?
- Is a reductive analysis of higher-order causation in terms of mechanisms feasible?
- What role does abstraction play in explaining the notion of downward causation?
